        <h3>Branding and Product Design</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy the process of designing the FatBuniverse brand, developing the platform, and bringing the merch to life. This isn't just a comic and e-commerce platform—it's PanPanRabbit's universe. Through the stories of the rabbit, I hope every reader could find their inner happiness and bravely protect their every little dreams. Even a little rabbit can be the protagonist in their own universe.</p>
        <h3>Game Collaboration & Special Events</h3>
        <p>I love creating playful crossovers! In my indie game Infinite Dawn, we ran a special event: buying a PanPanRabbit comic book gave players a code to unlock a vitual Panpan rabbit in the game. Now, with the e-commerce platform, sharing news, events, and virtual products are easier than ever, and there’s so much more excitement to come!</p>
        <h3>Portfolio Copy Example</h3>
        <p>The shop features playful copywriting and professional photos. Future plans include community features, AI chatbots, and more interactive experiences to make FatBuniverse engaging and fun.</p>
